    <h1>justify-content</h1>
    <p>
      In previous exercises, when we changed the display value of parent
      containers to flex or inline-flex, all of the child elements (flex items)
      moved toward the upper left corner of the parent container. This is the
      default behavior of flex containers and their children. We can specify how
      flex items spread out from left to right, along the main axis. We will
      learn more about axes in a later exercise.
    </p>

    <p>
      To position the items from left to right, we use a property called
      justify-content.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .container {
          display: flex;
          justify-content: flex-end;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, we set the value of justify-content to flex-end.
      This will cause all of the flex items to shift to the right side of the
      flex container.
    </p>

    <p>Below are five commonly used values for the justify-content property:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        flex-start — all items will be positioned in order, starting from the
        left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-end — all items will be positioned in order, with the last item
        starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space
        between or after them.
      </li>
      <li>
        center — all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the
        parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.
      </li>
      <li>
        space-around — items will be positioned with equal space before and
        after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        space-between — items will be positioned with equal space between them,
        but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the definitions above, “no extra space” means that margins and borders
      will be respected, but no more space (than is specified in the style rule
      for the particular element) will be added between elements. The size of
      each individual flex item is not changed by this property.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>
            Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id flexstart a
            justify-content property with a value of flex-start.
          </p>
          <p>
            You won’t see any changes since flex-start is the default value;
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id flexend a justify-content
        property with a value of flex-end.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id center a justify-content
        property with a value of center.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>
            Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id spacearound a
            justify-content property with a value of space-around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stretch and shrink the browser window to compare and contrast how
            the elements in each div behave.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id spacebetween a justify-content
        property with a value of space-between.
      </li>
    </ol>
