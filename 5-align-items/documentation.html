    <h1>align-items</h1>
    <p>
      In the previous exercise, you learned how to justify the content of a flex
      container from left to right across the page. It is also possible to align
      flex items vertically within the container. The align-items property makes
      it possible to space flex items vertically.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .container {
          align-items: baseline;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, the align-items property is set to baseline. This
      means that the baseline of the content of each item will be aligned.
    </p>

    <p>Below are five commonly used values for the align-items property:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        flex-start — all elements will be positioned at the top of the parent
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-end — all elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        center — the center of all elements will be positioned halfway between
        the top and bottom of the parent container
      </li>
      <li>
        baseline — the bottom of the content of all items will be aligned with
        each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        stretch — if possible, the items will stretch from top to bottom of the
        container (this is the default value; elements with a specified height
        will not stretch; elements with a minimum height or no height specified
        will stretch).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These five values tell the elements how to behave along the cross axis of
      the parent container. In these examples, the cross axis stretches from top
      to bottom of the container. We’ll learn more about this in a future
      exercise.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might be unfamiliar with the min-height and max-height properties, but
      you have used height and width before. min-height, max-height, min-width,
      and max-width are properties that ensure an element is at least a certain
      size or at most a certain size. You’ll see how these become useful as you
      move throughout this lesson.
    </p>

    <p>Now you’re going to see each of the five values above in action!</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>
            Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id flexstartan align-items
            property with the value flex-start.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id flexend an align-items
        property with a value of flex-end.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the &LT;div&GT; element with the id center an align-items
        property with a value of center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign the &LT;div&GT; elementwith id baseline an align-items property
        with the value baseline. How does the behavior of these elements differ
        from those in other divs?
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a look at the elements under “Stretch” at the bottom of the page.
        Now, in the .left, .center, .right ruleset, change the height property
        to min-height and observe what happens to these elements.
      </li>
