    <h1>flex</h1>
    <p>
      The shorthand flex property provides a convenient way for specifying how
      elements stretch and shrink, while simplifying the CSS required. The flex
      property allows you to declare flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis all
      in one line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: The flex property is different from the flex value used for the
      display property.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .big {
          flex-grow: 2;
          flex-shrink: 1;
          flex-basis: 150px;
        }

        .small {
          flex-grow: 1;
          flex-shrink: 2;
          flex-basis: 100px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, all elements with class big will grow twice as much
      as elements with class small. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean big items
      will be twice as big as small items, they’ll just take up more of the
      extra space.
    </p>

    <p>The CSS below declares these three properties in one line.</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .big {
          flex: 2 1 150px;
        }

        .small {
          flex: 1 2 100px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, we use the flex property to declare the values for
      flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis (in that order) all in one line.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .big {
          flex: 2 1;
         }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, we use the flex property to declare flex-grow and
      flex-shrink, but not flex-basis.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .small {
          flex: 1 20px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, we use the flex property to declare flex-grow and
      flex-basis. Note that there is no way to set only flex-shrink and
      flex-basis using 2 values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The browser to the right has two flex containers, each with three flex
      items. In style.css, examine the values for each of these items. Notice
      that the flex-grow and flex-basis values are set for the blue divs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stretch the browser window to increase its width. Observe that once the
      top outer divs reach 100 pixels wide, they begin to grow faster than the
      top center div. Also notice that once the bottom center div reaches 100
      pixels wide, it begins to grow faster than the outer divs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, shrink the browser window and notice that once the top center div
      reaches 50 pixels wide it begins to shrink faster than the outer divs and
      when the bottom outer divs reach 75 pixels, they begin to shrink faster
      than the center div.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In #top .side, all three values for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and
        flex-basis are assigned individually. Refactor them to be declared in
        one line using the shorthand flex property.
      </li>
      <li>
        In #top .center, all three values for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and
        flex-basis are assigned individually. Refactor them to be declared in
        one line.
      </li>
      <li>
        In #bottom .side, all three values for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and
        flex-basis are assigned individually. Refactor them to be declared in
        one line.
