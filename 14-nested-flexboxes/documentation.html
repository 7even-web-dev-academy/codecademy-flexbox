    <h1>nested flexboxes</h1>

    <p>
      So far, weâ€™ve had multiple flex containers on the same page to explore
      flex item positioning. It is also possible to position flex containers
      inside of one another.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        &LT;div class='container'&GT;
          &LT;div class='left'&GT;
            &LT;img class='small' src='#'/&GT;
            &LT;img class='small' src='#'/&GT;
            &LT;img class='small' src='#' /&GT;
          &LT;/div&GT;
          &LT;div class='right'&GT;
            &LT;img class='large' src='#' /&GT;
          &LT;/div&GT;
        &LT;/div&GT;
      </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .container {
          display: flex;
          justify-content: center;
          align-items: center;
        }

        .left {
          display: inline-flex;
          flex: 2 1 200px;
          flex-direction: column;
        }

        .right {
          display: inline-flex;
          flex: 1 2 400px;
          align-items: center;
        }

        .small {
          height: 200px;
          width: auto;
        }

        .large {
          height: 600px;
          width: auto;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, a div with three smaller images will display from
      top to bottom on the left of the page (.left). There is also a div with
      one large image that will display on the right side of the page (.right).
      The left div has a smaller flex-basis but stretches to fill more extra
      space; the right div has a larger flex-basis but stretches to fill less
      extra space. Both divs are flex items and flex containers. The items have
      properties that dictate how they will be positioned in the parent
      container and how their flex item children will be positioned in them.
    </p>

    <p>Note: The flex-flow property is declared on flex containers.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In the #row-reverse ruleset, set the flex-flow property to have a
        direction of row-reverse and to wrap elements. You should be able to
        accomplish this in one line.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the #column ruleset, set the flex-flow property to give elements a
        direction of column and to wrap elements. You should be able to
        accomplish this in one line.
      </li>
    </ol>
