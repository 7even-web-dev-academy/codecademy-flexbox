    <h1>Review: Flexbox</h1>

    <p>
      You should be proud of yourself! You have learned the most important
      properties of flexbox. Flexbox is an art and a science; you can use it to
      make laying out multiple elements a piece of cake. You know everything
      necessary to begin using it in your own projects.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex
        items inside of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline
        with each other.
      </li>
      <li>justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.</li>
      <li>align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.</li>
      <li>
        flex-grow is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions)
        flex items absorb along the main axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-shrink is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what
        proportions along the main axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with
        flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one
        declaration.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-wrap specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if
        the flex container is not large enou
      </li>
      <li>align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis.</li>
      <li>flex-direction is used to specify the main and cross axes.</li>
      <li>
        flex-flow is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one
        declaration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring display:
        flex or display: inline-flex for children of flex containers.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Let’s apply a few of the properties you’ve learned to arrange one section
      of the web page in the browser to the right!
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>
            All of the images are inside of three column divs and the three
            column divs are all inside of one large div called .cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the .cards ruleset, add a display property with a value of
            flex.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, inside the .cards ruleset, set the flex-wrap property to have a
        value of wrap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inside the .cards ruleset, set the justify-content property to have a
        value of space-around.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the .col ruleset, set the display property to have a value of
        inline-flex.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the .col ruleset, set the flex-direction property to have a value of
        column.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the .col ruleset, set the justify-content property to have a value of
        space-between.
      </li>
    </ol>
