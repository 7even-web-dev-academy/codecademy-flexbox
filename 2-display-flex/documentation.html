    <h1>display: flex</h1>
    <p>
      Any element can be a flex container. Flex containers are helpful tools for
      creating websites that respond to changes in screen sizes. Child elements
      of flex containers will change size and location in response to the size
      and position of their parent container.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an element to become a flex container, its display property must be
      set to flex.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        div.container {
          display: flex;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, all divs with the class container are flex
      containers. If they have children, the children are flex items. A div with
      the declaration display: flex; will remain block level â€” no other elements
      will appear on the same line as it.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it will change the behavior of its child elements. Child elements
      will not begin on new lines. In the exercises that follow, we will cover
      how the flex display property impacts the positioning of child elements.
