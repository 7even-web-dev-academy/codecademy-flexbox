    <h1>What is Flexbox?</h1>
    <p>
      CSS provides many tools and properties that you can use to position
      elements on a webpage. Codecademy’s lessons on the box model and CSS
      display introduce a couple of these techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this lesson, you will learn about Flexible Box Layout or flexbox, a
      tool that greatly simplifies how to position elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two important components to a flexbox layout: flex containers
      and flex items. A flex container is an element on a page that contains
      flex items. All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items.
      This distinction is important because some of the properties you will
      learn in this lesson apply to flex containers while others apply to flex
      items.
    </p>

    <p>
      To designate an element as a flex container, set the element’s display
      property to flex or inline-flex. Once an item is a flex container, there
      are several properties we can use to specify how its children behave. In
      this lesson we will cover these properties:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>justify-content</li>
      <li>align-items</li>
      <li>flex-grow</li>
      <li>flex-shrink</li>
      <li>flex-basis</li>
      <li>flex</li>
      <li>flex-wrap</li>
      <li>align-content</li>
      <li>flex-direction</li>
      <li>flex-flow</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Flexbox is an elegant tool that makes it easy to address positioning issues
      that may have been difficult before. Let’s get started!
