    <h1>flex-shrink</h1>
    <p>
      Just as the flex-grow property proportionally stretches flex items, the
      flex-shrink property can be used to specify which elements will shrink and
      in what proportions.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may have noticed in earlier exercises that flex items shrank when the
      flex container was too small, even though we had not declared the
      property. This is because the default value of flex-shrink is 1. However,
      flex items do not grow unless the flex-grow property is declared because
      the default value of flex-grow is 0.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        &LT;div class='container'&GT;
          &LT;div class='side'&GT;
            &LT;h1&GT;Iâ€™m on the side of the flex container!&LT;/h1&GT;
          &LT;/div&GT;
          &LT;div class='center'&GT;
            &LT;h1&GT;I'm in the center of the flex container!&LT;/h1&GT;
          &LT;/div&GT;
          &LT;div class='side'&GT;
            &LT;h1&GT;I'm on the other side of the flex container!&LT;/h1&GT;
          &LT;/div&GT;
        &LT;/div&GT;
      </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
      <code>
        .container {
          display: flex;
        }

        .side {
          width: 100px;
          flex-shrink: 1;
        }

        .center {
          width: 100px;
          flex-shrink: 2;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the example above, the .center div will shrink twice as much as the
      .side divs if the .container div is too small to fit the elements within
      it. If the content is 60 pixels too large for the flex container that
      surrounds it, the .center div will shrink by 30 pixels and the outer divs
      will shrink by 15 pixels each. Margins are unaffected by flex-grow and
      flex-shrink.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind, minimum and maximum widths will take precedence over
      flex-grow and flex-shrink. As with flex-grow, flex-shrink will only be
      employed if the parent container is too small or the browser is adjusted.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>Assign .top.side a flex-shrink value of 2.</p>
          <p>
            Stretch and shrink the browser. Because the default value for
            flex-shrink is 1, the .top.center div will shrink but not as much as
            the .side divs.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>Assign .middle.side a flex-shrink value of 0.</p>
          <p>
            Stretch and shrink the browser. How do the .middle divs resize
            differently than the .top divs?
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>Assign the .bottom.center div a flex-shrink value of 2.</p>
          <p>
            Shrink and stretch the browser again. How do the .bottom divs resize
            differently than the .top and .middle divs?
          </p>
        </div>
